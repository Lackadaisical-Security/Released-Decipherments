# Released-Decipherments

This repository serves as a central hub for all public decipherment projects from the Lackadaisical Security research initiative. Each project represents extensive linguistic fieldwork, methodological insights, and decoded research logs for various ancient and undeciphered writing systems.

## Overview

The Lackadaisical Decipherment project encompasses groundbreaking research into some of history's most enigmatic writing systems. Our work combines traditional linguistic analysis with modern computational approaches to unlock the secrets of ancient scripts.

## Decipherment Projects
